It comes with advanced ways to select what links to download, and will remember your previous decisions so that you can queue more downloads with just OneClick!\n\nAdvanced users will also like using renaming masks, which let you automatically assign names (and even sub-folders within your downloads folder), fast-filtering or even custom, re-usable filters.\n\nDownThemAll is open-source and free. We spend a lot of time making it, and keep spending a lot of time improving it, and even fixing some problems in Firefox itself so DownThemAll! can work even better.\nWe will never add adware, spyware, user tracking or other nasty stuff. Therefore we rely on your donations exclusively to fund the development.\n\nWe are looking for people willing to help translate DownThemAll! to more languages. For a small guide on how to do that, please see our preliminary translation guide. You will get our gratitude, and the gratitude of all the users whose live you improved by bringing DownThemAll! to their language.\n\nPlease do NOT report any bugs and issues in the user review section, but file a bug report instead. This is the only way to make sure we actually see it, and it also makes communicating to us/with you a lot easier. Thanks\n\nPlease note: Version 4 of DownThemAll! is.a complete rewrite as a WebExtension, as the old add-on system was abandoned and disabled in Firefox. This was mozilla's decision, and there is nothing we can do about it. We are therefore limited to the tools the WebExtensions model provides to us, which sadly makes it impossible to provide some of the advanced features of DownThemAll! Version 3. Furthermore there are some bugs in Firefox that affect DownThemAll! as well, e.g. downloads will always succeed even if the server returns an error, but I fixed this in upcoming Firefox 71.\nHowever, we're still able to provide the advanced selection, queuing, file naming options of the old DownThemAll! and a lot more.","weeklyDownloads":5188,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Nils Maier","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/105689/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/224/224229.png?modified=1622132179","width":2400,"height":1463,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224229.jpg?modified=1622132179","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":325,"caption":"Quickly select links using advanced filters, automatically name files and folders with highly configurable masks"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/224/224230.png?modified=1622132194","width":2274,"height":1504,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224230.jpg?modified=1622132194","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":353,"caption":"Watch your download queue progress according to your global and per-domain limits.\r\nQuickly filter and search your queue to manage to find specific downloads in your queue."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/224/224231.png?modified=1622132196","width":506,"height":626,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224231.jpg?modified=1622132196","thumbnailWidth":323,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"DownThemAll! comes with a button that will allow you to quickly access it's main features, but it can be configured to be a OneClick! button instead."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/224/224232.png?modified=1622132203","width":1222,"height":1104,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224232.jpg?modified=1622132203","thumbnailWidth":443,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Add downloads from your context menu, e.g. the link, image or video you clicked, or only from queue from the part of the website you selected."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/224/224233.png?modified=1622132207","width":1072,"height":788,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224233.jpg?modified=1622132207","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":392,"caption":"DownThemAll! is also present in your tools menu, so you still have full access to its features even when you configured it to not show the context menu and changed the button to OneClick!"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/224/224234.png?modified=1622132213","width":1624,"height":966,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224234.jpg?modified=1622132213","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":317,"caption":"Of course, you can manually add downloads, too."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/224/224235.png?modified=1622132221","width":1624,"height":966,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224235.jpg?modified=1622132221","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":317,"caption":"Batch downloads are supported as well."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/224/224236.png?modified=1622132232","width":2274,"height":1576,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224236.jpg?modified=1622132232","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":369,"caption":"DownThemAll! comes with powerful preferences that let power users make the most of the extension, but also provides sensible defaults for people who just want to download quickly."}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/NilsMaier?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.2107,"reviewCount":258,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/reviews/","updateDate":1659518270000},{"id":"sponsorBlocker@ajay.app","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-32.png?modified=d215907f","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-64.png?modified=d215907f","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-128.png?modified=d215907f"},"name":"SponsorBlock - Skip Sponsorships on YouTube","version":"4.7.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3978884/sponsorblock-4.7.1.xpi","homepageURL":"https://sponsor.ajay.app","supportURL":"https://sponsor.ajay.app","description":"Easily skip YouTube video sponsors.

All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy. We do not—and will never—collect any of your usage data.\n\nWhat do I do if I have trouble?\nVisit our GitLab page or check out our wiki.\n\nWrite us...\nIf have any suggestions or complaints, please contact us on GitLab.\n\nPermissions\nReasoning for needed permissions can be found under here.\n\nContributors\n\n    Kevin Röbert (creator/developer)\n    Yi-Ping Huang (translator)\n    rayman89 (translator)\n    Ramon Santilli (translator)\n    Lucifer (translator)\n    Shitennouji (translator)\n    perdolka (contributor)\n    Nameless (contributor)\n    a-polivanchuk (translator)\n    hydrargyrum (translator)\n    alekksander (translator)\n    Zoltan Toldy (translator)\n    tartpvule (contributor)\n    Giovanni (translator)\n    U.

If a web site locks you out because your browser does not support a feature they require then changing the User-Agent will not make any difference.\n\n* Also changes navigator.userAgent, as well generating convincing values for several of the other navigator.* properties.\n\n– Translating “User-Agent Switcher” to a new language\nAny help in translating this extension is greatly appreciated! To do so, simply visit our project on the WebLate hosted instance, create an account and either select an existing language or add a new one to get going. Thanks for helping out!\n\n(Alternatively you may submit a merge request on GitLab with the updated translation files or send me the translations using the “Support E-mail”-Address.)\n\n– Getting Help\nFound a bug or want a new feature? Please use the GitLab issue tracker to submit these instead of just mentioning them as part of your reviews. This way it becomes much easier for me to keep track of reported issues and get back to you if additional information is needed to help you.\n\nPlease note however that “User-Agent Switcher” is mostly in maintenance-only mode now and new features will not be added by me (the primary author, Alexander Schlarb) anymore. I'm still open for patches from the community however and would also welcome your support through the linked BountySource buttons under each Feature Request issue in the tracker.\n\n– Watching it work\nIf you want to watch User Agent Changer work, there are a few things you could try:\n\n    Use a web service (such as UserAgentString.com) to see your currently sent User-Agent header.\n    Use the built-in Network Analyzer (Ctrl-Shift-Q) to view the User-Agent header.\n    Enter navigator.userAgent into the Scripting Console (Ctrl-Shift-K) to view the client-side User-Agent value.\n\n\n– Frequently Asked Questions\n\n    Why doesn't the extension work on this very site (Mozilla/Firefox Add-ons)?\n\n    To find out more about why these restrictions exist and how disable them if you must, please take a look at the following blog article: https://ninetailed.ninja/extensions-modify-mozilla-sites.html\n\n    (This information was moved from this extension's description to an external source, since a Mozilla reviewer felt that suggesting changes like the one proposed in the linked article are not acceptable for the listing of sandboxed browser extension.)\n    Why is the extension file so large (4 MiB) compared to others?\n\n    In order to provide almost perfect emulation of User-Agent values, User Agent-Switcher bundles a stripped-down version of BrowsCap. This allows us to derive all relevant JavaScript navigator.* browser/OS identification values from just a single value: The User-Agent value you enter (and a bit of magic behind the scenes). Other extensions with a similarly complete level of emulation used to store all these values in huge tables along with the User-Agent value itself, making it very hard to add new entries.\n\n    Doing this kind of emulation without using BrowsCap would be extremely hard for us, as there are only few rules regarding the structure of User-Agent strings and the most interesting part end up in the extremely browser-specific comment section of the string. As such, we consider these extra 3MiB+ of data shipped with the extension a fair price to pay for having almost perfect out-of-the-box emulation of all these values with no extra user configuration required.\n\n    And yes, the BrowsCap data is here to stay and if you cannot cope with the extra size this causes please kindly download a different extension and don't down-vote. Other people appreciate this decision even if you don't.\n    Can this extension be installed on Firefox for Android?\n\n    Unfortunately Mozilla decided to limit support for extensions on their new Fenix browser platform to just a limited set of recommended extensions. You can read their official “rational” for this on their add-on blog: https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/02/11/faq-for-extension-support-in-new-firefox-for-android/\n\n    If you want to use the extension anyways and are comfortable with switching to Firefox for Android Nightly, they added a convoluted process you can follow to install any extension not official endorsed by them for their new mobile platform: https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/. Note that I cannot test this myself as Mozilla dropped support for my device with the switch to the new platform, but user-feedback so far has been positive.","weeklyDownloads":1934,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Kuri Schlarb","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5622055/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187816.png?modified=1622132699","width":341,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187816.jpg?modified=1622132699","thumbnailWidth":260,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Icon with Popup Menu"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187814.png?modified=1622132699","width":299,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187814.jpg?modified=1622132699","thumbnailWidth":228,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Random User-Agent Mode"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187817.png?modified=1622132700","width":700,"height":408,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187817.jpg?modified=1622132700","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":311,"caption":"Preferences (Table Mode)"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/187/187818.png?modified=1622132700","width":700,"height":408,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/187/187818.jpg?modified=1622132700","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":311,"caption":"Preferences (Text Mode)"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4141,"reviewCount":166,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/reviews/","updateDate":1607387420000},{"id":"{529b261b-df0b-4e3b-bf42-07b462da0ee8}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/951/951399-32.png?modified=82fd0582","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/951/951399-64.png?modified=82fd0582","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/951/951399-128.png?modified=82fd0582"},"name":"Universal Bypass","version":"13.15.2.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3815811/universal_bypass-13.15.2.1.xpi","homepageURL":"https://universal-bypass.org/","supportURL":"https://universal-bypass.org/","description":"Don't waste your time with compliance.

Nobody else decides for you: You choose. You are in full control of your privacy.\n\nOut of the box, uMatrix works in relax block-all/allow-exceptionally mode, meaning web sites which require 3rd-party scripts are likely to be \"broken\". With two clicks, uMatrix can be set to work in allow-all/block-exceptionally mode, which generally will not break web sites. See https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views for more details on this topic.\n\n* See ALL the remote connections, failed or attempted, depending on whether they were blocked or allowed (you decide).\n\n* A single-click to whitelist/blacklist one or multiple classes of requests according to the destination and type of data (a blocked request will NEVER leave your browser).\n\n* Efficient blacklisting: cookies won't leave your browser, JavaScript won't execute, plugins won't play, tracking pixels won't download, etc.\n\n* You do not have to solely rely on just one particular curated blacklist (arguably with many missing entries) outside which nothing else can be blocked: You are in full control.\n\n* Ease of use: uMatrix lets you easily whitelist/blacklist net requests which originate from within a web page according to a point-and-click matrix:\n\n- domain names (left column)\n* from very specific\n* to very generic\n\n- type of requests (top row)\n* cookies\n* CSS-related resources (stylesheets and web fonts)\n* images\n* plugins\n* scripts\n* XHR (requests made by scripts)\n* frames\n* others\n\nYou can blacklist/whitelist a single cell, an entire row, a group of rows, an entire column, or the whole matrix with just one click.\n\nuMatrix's filtering engine uses precedence logic to evaluate what is blocked/allowed according to which cells are blacklisted/whitelisted. For example, this allows you to whitelist a whole page with one click, without having to repeatedly whitelist whatever new data appear on the page.\n\nAll rules are scoped. For example, you can block `facebook.com` and `facebook.net` everywhere except when visiting a page on `www.facebook.com`. This way Facebook won't be able to build a profile of your browsing habits.\n\nThe goal of this extension is to make the allowing or blocking of web sites, wholly or partly, as straightforward as possible, so as to encourage users to care about their privacy.\n\nThe extension comes with 3rd-party hosts files totaling over 62,000 distinct hostnames (lists can be selectively disabled/enabled according to your choice).\n\nUltimately, you can choose however you browse the net:\n\n* Blacklist all by default, and whitelist as needed (default mode).\n\n* Whitelist all by default, and blacklist as needed.\n\nEither way, you still benefit from the preset blacklists so that at least you get basic protection from trackers, malware sites, etc. Or you can disable all of these preset blacklists.\n\nYour choice.\n\nRandomly assembled documentation: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki\n\n=====\n\nThis extension is also useful to understand what the web page in your browser is doing, often without your knowledge. You have full ability to see and decide with whom a web page communicates, and to restrict these communications to specific classes of objects within the web page.\n\nThe number which appear in the extension icon correspond to the total number of distinct requests attempted (successfully or not depending on whether these were allowed or blocked) by the web page.\n\nSimply click on the appropriate entry in the matrix in order to white-, black- or graylist a component. Graylisting means the blocked or allowed status will be inherited from another cell with higher precedence in the matrix.\n\nRed square = effectively blacklisted, i.e. requests are prevented from reaching their intended destination:\n* Dark red square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically blacklisted.\n* Faded red square: the blacklist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nGreen square = effectively whitelisted, i.e. requests are allowed to reach their intended destination:\n* Dark green square: the domain name and/or type of request is specifically whitelisted.\n* Faded green square: the whitelist status is inherited because the entry is graylisted.\n\nThe top-left cell in the matrix, the \"all\" cell, represents the default global setting, which allows you to choose whether allowing or blocking everything is the default behavior. Some prefer to allow everything while blocking exceptionally. My personal preference is of course the reverse, blocking everything and allowing exceptionally.\n\nThis extension is also useful if you wish to speed up your browsing, by globally blocking all requests for images as an example.\n\n=====\n\nBUGS, ISSUES: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/issues\n\nSOURCE CODE: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix (GPLv3)\n\nCHANGE LOG: https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases","weeklyDownloads":741,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11423598/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/158/158458.png?modified=1622132459","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158458.jpg?modified=1622132459","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Point and click to allow/block narrow or broad classes of network requests.

If privacy.resistFingerprinting has been turned on from about:config, make sure to also enable keyboard navigation from the extension's options.\n\nMotivation\n\nreCAPTCHA challenges remain a considerable burden on the web, delaying and often blocking our access to services and information depending on our physical and cognitive abilities, our social and cultural background, and the devices or networks we connect from.\n\nThe difficulty of captchas can be so out of balance, that sometimes they seem friendlier to bots than they are to humans.\n\nThe goal of this project is to improve our experience with captchas, by giving us easy access to solutions already utilized by automated systems.\n\nRequired permissions:\n\n    Access your data for all websites: required for accessing challenges\n    Exchange messages with programs other than Firefox: needed for interacting with the client app when user input simulation is enabled\n    Display notifications: used for displaying error messages\n    Access browser activity during navigation: needed for resetting challenges\n\n\nThe extension is also available for Chrome and Edge.\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please use GitHub for issues and feature requests.\nhttps://github.com/dessant/buster","weeklyDownloads":968,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Armin Sebastian","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12929064/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/211/211910.png?modified=1622134177","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/211/211910.jpg?modified=1622134177","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Solve the captcha by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/211/211911.png?modified=1622134179","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/211/211911.jpg?modified=1622134179","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Solve the captcha by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget."}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=GLL4UNSNU6SQN&utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":3.922,"reviewCount":115,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/buster-captcha-solver/reviews/","updateDate":1635853098000},{"id":"{b86e4813-687a-43e6-ab65-0bde4ab75758}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2627/2627159-32.png?modified=b2f5fc36","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2627/2627159-64.png?modified=b2f5fc36","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2627/2627159-128.png?modified=b2f5fc36"},"name":"LocalCDN","version":"2.6.32","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3985626/localcdn_fork_of_decentraleyes-2.6.32.xpi","homepageURL":"https://www.localcdn.org","supportURL":"https://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN","description":"Emulates remote frameworks (e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS) and delivers them as local resource.

It intercepts traffic, finds supported resources locally, and injects them into the environment. All of this happens automatically, so no prior configuration is required.\n\nDifferences between LocalCDN and Decentraleyes\nLocalCDN contains a big collection of frameworks and useful functions.\n\n    New: Sync extension settings with Firefox Sync or own server\n    Includes Rocket Loader, Findify, Vue.js, page.js, lozad, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Google Material Icons, React, Vue, Chart.js and much more. The list will be continuously updated.\n    Includes Font Awesome in different version (v3.x, v4.x, v5.x, v6.x)\n    Prepared rules for uBlock Origin/uMatrix/AdGuard and notifications if rule changes are necessary\n    Removes integrity/crossorigin attributes to replace more frameworks\n\nAdds protection from\n\n    Font Awesome (3.x, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x)\n    jQuery up to 3.6.0\n    Bootstrap CSS (Delivered by StackPath, NetDNA and MaxCDN)\n    Bootstrap JavaScript (Delivered by StackPath, NetDNA and MaxCDN)\n    MathJax\n    AngularJS, AngularJS-Animate, AngularJS-Sanitize, AngularJS-Cookies and AngularJS-Touch\n    ...and more (>200 different frameworks in various versions in total!)\n\nSource code\nhttps://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN\n\nWould you like to see other CDN or versions (e.g. jQuery or Bootstrap) integrated? Feel free to open an issue or pull request.\n\nDonations are possible. The possibilities for donations can be displayed in the extension. (Reduces traffic and prevents your IP from being listed in the server logs. Therefore a small offline help page is also integrated.)\n\nFor clarification: This extension doesn't create an external connection by itself. LocalCDN contains these frameworks/libraries in add-on storage. This is the reason why the size of LocalCDN is 17 MB. There is also a donation page and a short FAQ page inside the extension. There are only external connections in the form of hyperlinks that the user must actively click on. This includes, for example, the test page or the translation platform \"Weblate\". All links are marked.\n\n---\n\nThis add-on is a fork of https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes","weeklyDownloads":446,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"nobody","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/15698979/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/271/271246.png?modified=1657374986","width":350,"height":281,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/271/271246.jpg?modified=1657374986","thumbnailWidth":350,"thumbnailHeight":281,"caption":"Clean website without 3rd party scripts (LocalCDN: enabled.
