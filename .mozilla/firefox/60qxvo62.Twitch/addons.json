All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

Challenges are solved by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget.\n\nIt is not guaranteed that challenges are always solved, the limitations of the technology need to be considered.\n\nThe continued development of Buster is made possible thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please consider contributing with Patreon, PayPal or Bitcoin.\n\nClient app\n\nThe success rate of the extension can be improved by simulating user interactions with the help of a client app. Follow the instructions from the extension's options to download and install the client app on Windows, Linux and macOS, or get the app from this repository.\n\nSolving more than a couple of reCAPTCHA challenges a day may lead to a temporary block, regardless of your use of the extension. Visit the wiki for more details.\n\nAnti-fingerprinting prevents the client app from moving the mouse as expected. If privacy.resistFingerprinting has been turned on from about:config, make sure to also enable keyboard navigation from the extension's options.\n\nMotivation\n\nreCAPTCHA challenges remain a considerable burden on the web, delaying and often blocking our access to services and information depending on our physical and cognitive abilities, our social and cultural background, and the devices or networks we connect from.\n\nThe difficulty of captchas can be so out of balance, that sometimes they seem friendlier to bots than they are to humans.\n\nThe goal of this project is to improve our experience with captchas, by giving us easy access to solutions already utilized by automated systems.\n\nRequired permissions:\n\n    Access your data for all websites: required for accessing challenges\n    Exchange messages with programs other than Firefox: needed for interacting with the client app when user input simulation is enabled\n    Display notifications: used for displaying error messages\n    Access browser activity during navigation: needed for resetting challenges\n\n\nThe extension is also available for Chrome and Edge.\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please use GitHub for issues and feature requests.\nhttps://github.com/dessant/buster","weeklyDownloads":804,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Armin Sebastian","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12929064/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/211/211910.png?modified=1622134177","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/211/211910.jpg?modified=1622134177","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Solve the captcha by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/211/211911.png?modified=1622134179","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/211/211911.jpg?modified=1622134179","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"Solve the captcha by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget."}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=GLL4UNSNU6SQN&utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":3.9186,"reviewCount":114,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/buster-captcha-solver/reviews/","updateDate":1635853098000},{"id":"{b86e4813-687a-43e6-ab65-0bde4ab75758}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2627/2627159-32.png?modified=b2f5fc36","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2627/2627159-64.png?modified=b2f5fc36","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2627/2627159-128.png?modified=b2f5fc36"},"name":"LocalCDN","version":"2.6.31","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3979425/localcdn_fork_of_decentraleyes-2.6.31.xpi","homepageURL":"https://www.localcdn.org","supportURL":"https://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN","description":"Emulates remote frameworks (e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap, AngularJS) and delivers them as local resource.

(Reduces traffic and prevents your IP from being listed in the server logs. Therefore a small offline help page is also integrated.)\n\nFor clarification: This extension doesn't create an external connection by itself. LocalCDN contains these frameworks/libraries in add-on storage. This is the reason why the size of LocalCDN is 17 MB. There is also a donation page and a short FAQ page inside the extension. There are only external connections in the form of hyperlinks that the user must actively click on. This includes, for example, the test page or the translation platform \"Weblate\".
